/**
 * \brief Reader ala DOM (Document Object Model)
 *
 * Detailled description here
 *
 * A DataSet DOES NOT contains group 0x0002
 *
 * This is really a DataSet reader. This will not make sure the dataset
 * conform to any IOD at all. This is a completely different step. The
 * reasoning was that user could control the IOD there lib would handle
 * and thus we would not be able to read a DataSet if the IOD was not found
 * Instead we separate the reading from the validation.
 *
 * NOTE:
 * From GDCM1.x. Users will realize that one feature is missing
 * from this DOM implementation. In GDCM 1.x user used to be able to
 * control the size of the Value to be read. By default it was 0xfff.
 * The main author of GDCM2 thought this was too dangerous and harmful and
 * therefore this feature did not make it into GDCM2
 *
 * WARNING:
 * GDCM will not produce warning for unorder (non-alphabetical order). 
 * See gdcm::Writer for more info
